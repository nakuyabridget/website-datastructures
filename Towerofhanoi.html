    <p>The course gives students a firm foundation of data structures and algorithms. The course trains students on systematic development and analysis of algorithms.  The importance of algorithm complexity on computer performance is emphasized. Typical computational problems and their solutions/analysis are to be covered.

    <h1><b><strong>TOWER OF HANOI</h1></b></strong>
    <p>Tower of Hanoi, is a mathematical puzzle which consists of three tower pegs and more than one
    rings; as depicted below :-
These rings are of different sizes and stacked upon in ascending order i.e. the smaller one sits over
the larger one. There are other variations of puzzle where the number of disks increase, but the
tower count remains the same.
Rules
The mission is to move all the disks to some another tower without violating the sequence of
arrangement. The below mentioned are few rules which are to be followed for tower of hanoi −
Only one disk can be moved among the towers at any given time.
Only the "top" disk can be removed.
No large disk can sit over a small disk.
Here is an animated representation of solving a tower of hanoi puzzle with three disks −
Tower of hanoi puzzle with n disks can be solved in minimum 2 n −1 steps. This presentation shows
that a puzzle with 3 disks has taken 2 3 −1 = 7 steps.
Algorithm
To write an algorithm for Tower of Hanoi, first we need to learn how to solve this problem with
lesser amount of disks, say → 1 or 2. We mark three towers with name, source, destination and
aux onlytohelpmovingdisks. If we have only one disk, then it can easily be moved from source to
destination peg.
If we have 2 disks −
First we move the smaller one top disk to aux peg
Then we move the larger one bottom disk to destination pegAnd finally, we move the smaller one from aux to destination peg.
So now we are in a position to design algorithm for Tower of Hanoi with more than two disks. We
divide the stack of disks in two parts. The largest disk (n th disk) is in one part and all other n − 1
disks are in second part.
Our ultimate aim is to move disk n from source to destination and then put all other n − 1 disks onto
it. Now we can imagine to apply the same in recursive way for all given set of disks.
So steps to follow are −
Step 1 − Move n-1 disks from source to aux
Step 2 − Move n th disk from source to dest
Step 3 − Move n-1 disks from aux to dest
A recursive algorithm for Tower of Hanoi can be driven as follows −
START
Procedure Hanoi(disk, source, dest, aux)
IF disk == 0, THEN
move disk from
ELSE
Hanoi(disk - 1,
move disk from
Hanoi(disk - 1,
END IF
source to dest
source, aux, dest)
source to dest
aux, dest, source)
// Step 1
// Step 2
// Step 3
END Procedure
STOP
